    /*
     Yipeng - I will make player movement script and buoyancy calculator with rigidbody, if it doesn't work ill make the physics myself.
    I am also planning on making camera follow player after it touches a hidden trigger just above the water



    2024/08/09
    The lobby camera zoom will be 9, once the player dives into the water it will change to ~7 and follow the player.
    when player is underwater i might add a slightly transparent layer to make the screen look like it's underwater
    me make smooth camera movement on dive into water, coyote jumping and sounds now at 2am (nvm i no do sound rn me lazy)
